# A Better PRNG
## XORShift Improved

A pseudo random number generator made by Michael HÃ¥kansson and Hampus Liljekvist as
a part of their B.Sc. degree project at the Royal Institue of Technology (KTH).
The algorithm is an improved version of XORShift, which is tested and compared to
the algorithms of the C++ Random library using TestU01.
